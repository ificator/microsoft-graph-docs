      Uri path requires navigating into unknown object hierarchy: missing property 'jobs' on 'synchronization'. Possible issues:
  	 1) Doc bug where 'jobs' isn't defined on the resource.
  	 2) Doc bug where 'jobs' is an example key and should instead be replaced with a placeholder like {item-id} or declared in the sampleKeys annotation.
  	 3) Doc bug where 'synchronization' is supposed to be an entity type, but is being treated as a complex because it (and its ancestors) are missing the keyProperty annotation."
